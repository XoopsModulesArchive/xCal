xCal Xoops Module Install Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release of xCal - the Xoops port of 
phpicalendar.  There are many more features in the works for
this module.  

To see the current development roadmap go to:

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------
To install this module extract the zip file to your /modules/
directory.  Change permissions on /modules/xCal/cache/ to '777'
on Unix servers and 'Full Control' to the Apache user on Windows 
servers. Then, login to your Xoops Control Panel and install the module
in "System" -> "Modules".

Configuring xCal
----------------------------------------------------------
Most of xCal's settings can be modified directly from the Xoops
control panel.  If your calendar was published using a different
zimezone than your web server, you can offset the time by 
changing the 'Calendar Timezone' field to reflect the proper
timezone.  A complete list of valid timezones are found in TIMEZONES

Publishing your calendar
----------------------------------------------------------
xCal is not a web calendar application, it is an iCal (.ics) calendar 
file viewer.  The calendar needs to be published into iCal format 
and uploaded to the /modules/xCal/calendars/ folder.  There are 
several applications that can create valid ICS files, including:

Mozilla Calendar (Windows, Unix)
Apple iCal       (Mac OS X)
Ximian Evolution (Unix)

Once the calendar has been created in iCal format, upload the
calendar file to the /modules/xCal/calendars/ folder.

Feature Requests / Bug Fixes
---------------------------------------------------------
If you encounter a bug with xCal, please describe the bug and
how to duplicate it in the forum on:
http://ackbarr.greatweb.com/xoops2/

Please do not contact me about adding an event add/edit/delete 
function to xCal.  I have future plans for implementing this, 
but have no idea how long that would take to complete.

If someone else would like to donate time/code to do so, feel free.
